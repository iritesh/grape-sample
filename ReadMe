For this project to pass this test you have to install PostGreSQL database
then create a super user and password 
let us say your super user is super_user and password is password
you have to edit local_setup.rb
in line 3 it is
DB = Sequel.connect('postgres://ritesh:newpassword@localhost')  #ritesh is my super user and newpassword was my pasword on localhost
you have to replace it with
DB = Sequel.connect('postgre://super_user:password@localhost')

then in terminal run 

ruby local_setup.rb           #(ensure that you have installed required gems in script)
then all is set for running this app on your local server
then chage directory to rack_app
cd rack_app
there is a file in rack_app with name grape_user_api.rb

in this file you have to edit line no 27
DB = Sequel.connect('postgres://ritesh:newpassword@localhost')
to 
DB = Sequel.connect('postgre://super_user:password@localhost')
please replace variable super_user and password according to you

and then run bundle install
after that you have to run command
rackup config.ru

and you can see response at localhost:9292/users/1
you can use parameters include exclude for getting attributes of your choice

valid attributes are
first_name
last_name
email
zipcode
company_name
google_profile
skype  
phone
about
linkedin_profile_url
company_url
needs 
offering
upcoming_meetings
past_meetings 
top_matches 
you can use exclude parameter for excluding some attributes and rest will be included automatically

in test1.rb on line 42,101 i have written my string for connecting for mine is

DB = Sequel.connect('postgres://ritesh:newpassword@localhost')
you have to edit it with your super user and password

DB(Sequel.connect('postgres://super_user:password@localhost'))

 
then run command bundle exec rspec test1.rb
and you will see that all the five tests are passing successfully
